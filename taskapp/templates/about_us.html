        <p>Hey there! We're Tracy & George, the proud parents behind Tiny Tasker. We understand the joys and challenges of parenthood, and we're on a mission to make the lives of parents a bit easier.

That's how we created Tiny Tasker, an application designed to streamline, schedule, manage, discover and pay for our little one’s extracurricular activities.</p>
        <p>We welcome you to join our community and discover the ease with which we can manage our little one’s time as well as ours.</p>
